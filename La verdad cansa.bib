	abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the effects of three prebiotics (inulin, β-glucan, and chitosan) on the physiological performance of Totoaba macdonaldi juveniles under culture conditions. The respiratory burst and the leucocyte content were measured in the blood to assess innate immune responses. The intestinal digestive capacity was evaluated by analyzing trypsin, amylase, and lipase activities, whereas the effects of such prebiotics at the transcriptomic level were assessed by implementing the RNA-Seq of liver tissue. After 60 days, fish fed with 0.5\% chitosan diets showed the highest respiratory burst, the lowest lipase activity, and the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), where biological processes related to proteolysis, digestion, and lipid hydroxylation were the most affected. In addition, fish from the chitosan diet showed the highest expression of immunoglobulin genes. In contrast, fish fed with the 1\% inulin diet presented the highest diet digestibility and trypsin and lipase activities. These physiological effects align with the highest expression of trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like genes in the liver of fish from this diet. On the other hand, fish fed the 0.1\% β-glucan diets showed the lowest amount of DEGs compared to the control group, most of which were associated with immune response, with an up-regulation of genes related to the complement system and a downregulation of immunoglobulin genes. Based on our results, we propose the inclusion of 1\% dietary inulin to improve the digestibility of experimental diets and the addition of 0.5\% chitosan to stimulate the immune system of T. macdonaldi juveniles.},

	abstract = {Psychobiotics—live microorganisms with potential mental health benefits, which can modulate the microbiota-gut-brain-axis via immune, humoral, neural, and metabolic pathways—are emerging as novel therapeutic options for the effective treatment of psychiatric disorders Recently, microbiome studies have identified numerous putative psychobiotic strains, of which short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria have attracted special attention from neurobiologists. Recent studies have highlighted that SCFAs-producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium have a very specific function in various psychiatric disorders, suggesting that these bacteria can be potential novel psychobiotics. SCFAs, potential mediators of microbiota-gut-brain axis, might modulate function of neurological processes. While the specific roles and mechanisms of SCFAs-producing bacteria of microbiota-targeted interventions on neuropsychiatric disease are largely unknown. This Review summarizes existing knowledge on the neuroprotective effects of the SCFAs-producing bacteria in neurological disorders via modulating microbiota-gut-brain axis and illustrate their possible mechanisms by which SCFAs-producing bacteria may act on these disorders, which will shed light on the SCFAs-producing bacteria as a promising novel source of psychobiotics.},

              The intestinal epithelial layer forms a barrier through cell–cell tight junctions and breaking or even slightly disrupting this barrier can lead to serious pathological consequences, including infection and inflammation. Various amino acids have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal barrier has been controversial. Here, an
              in vitro
              Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary
              l
              -Tryptophan (
              l
              -Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal tight junction injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary
              l
              -Trp protected and repaired the integrity and permeability injury of the intestinal tight junction induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (
              P
              {\textless} 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (
              P
              {\textless} 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary
              l
              -Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary
              l

              via
              inhibiting the NFκB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary

              -Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (

For its interaction with human health, environment and relevant commercial interest in biotechnology-based production, rapid and speciﬁc quantiﬁcation method for this molecule accessible to common laboratories is badly needed. We herein reported a simple colorimetric method for free tryptophan quantiﬁcation with 96-wellplate-level throughput. Our protocol ﬁrstly converted tryptophan to indole enzymatically by puriﬁed tryptophanases and then used reactivity of indole with hydroxylamine to form pink product with absorption peak at 530 nm, enabling the quantiﬁcation of tryptophan with simple spectrometry in just two hours. We presented that this method exhibited a linear detection range from 100 μM to 600 μM (R2 = 0.9969) with no detection towards other naturally occurring tryptophan analogs or tryptophan residues in proteins. It was very robust in complicated biological samples, as demonstrated by quantifying the titer of 36 mutated tryptophanproducing strains with Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of 0.93 in contrast to that measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Our method should be potent for routine free tryptophan quantiﬁcation in a high-throughput manner, facilitating studies in medicine, microbiology, food chemistry, metabolic engineering, etc.},

This also regards so-called functional ingredients which may benefit health and welfare of the fish. In vitro cell line-based intestinal epithelial barrier models may serve as tools for narrowing down the broad range of ingredient options, to identify the most promising candidates before in vivo feeding trials are run. In vivo, differentiation of the various epithelial cells in the fish intestine, from the multipotent stem cells, takes place in the presence of a variety of substances from dietary and endogenous origin. Among these, bile salts have recently received attention as regulators of epithelial function in health and disease but have not, until now, been included in the medium when culturing fish gut epithelial cells in vitro. As bile salts are present at high levels in the chyme of the fish intestine, in particular in salmon and rainbow trout, mostly as taurocholate ({\textgreater}90\%), their role for effects of diet ingredients on the in vitro gut cell model should be understood.},

Signiﬁcantly higher amounts of 5-HT were detected in colonic tissues from Lc327 group mice compared to control mice. Immunohistochemistry assays revealed that signiﬁcantly higher frequency of the cells containing 5-HT markedly in colon from Lc327 group mice. In accordance with these ﬁndings, elevation in relative mRNA levels for tryptophan hydroxylase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme for mucosal 5-HT, was observed in colonic epithelium from Lc327 group mice. Additionally, oral administration of heat-killed Lc327 shortened the transit time of colonic bead expulsion in mice.

              ) intestinal cells (RTgutGC) were grown as monolayers on permeable supports leading to a two-compartment intestinal barrier model consisting of a polarized epithelium, dividing the system into an upper (apical) and a lower (basolateral) compartment, and thereby mimicking the intestinal lumen and the portal blood, respectively. The cells express the tight junction protein ZO-1 and build up a transepithelial electrical resistance comparable to the
              in vivo
              situation. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs; average hydrodynamic diameter: 73 ± 18 nm) were accumulated by RTgutGC cells in a time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent manner. Uptake of PS-NPs was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy. Cells formed an efficient barrier largely preventing the translocation of PS-NPs to the basolateral compartment. Taken together, these data demonstrate the suitability of the
              in vitro
              barrier model to study the effects of nanoparticles in fish intestinal epithelial cells.},

We investigated the serotonergic system in an agastric ﬁsh species, the ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) as it represents a unique model for intestinal function. Here we present evidence of the presence of enterochromafﬁn cells (EC cells) in the gut of ballan wrasse comprising transcriptomic data on EC markers like adra2a, trpa1, adgrg4, lmxa1, spack1, serpina10, as well as the localization of 5-HT and mRNA of the rate limiting enzyme; tryptophan hydroxylase (tph1) in the gut epithelium. Second, we examined the effects of dietary marine lipids on the enteric serotonergic system in this stomach-less teleost by administrating a hydrolyzed lipid bolus in ex vivo guts in an organ bath system. Modulation of the mRNA expression from the tryptophan hydroxylase tph1 (EC cells isoform), tph2 (neural isoform), and other genes involved in the serotonergic machinery were tracked. Our results showed no evidence to conﬁrm that the dietary lipid meal did boost the production of 5-HT within the EC cells as mRNA tph1 was weakly regulated postprandially. However, dietary lipid seemed to upregulate the postprandial expression of tph2 found in the serotonergic neurons. 5-HT in the intestinal tissue increased 3 hours after “exposure” of lipids, as was observed in the mRNA expression of tph2. This suggest that serotonergic neurons and not EC cells are responsible for the substantial increment of 5-HT after a lipid-reach “meal” in ballan wrasse. Cells expressing tph1 were identiﬁed in the gut epithelium, characteristic for EC cells. However, Tph1 positive cells were also present in the lamina propria. Characterization of these cells together with their implications in the serotonergic system will contribute to broad the scarce knowledge of the serotonergic system across teleosts.},

Indole and its derivatives, as the products of the gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan, can be used as ligands to regulate inflammation and autoimmune response in vivo. In recent years, some studies have found that the levels of indole and its derivatives differ significantly between patients with central nervous system diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be important mediators for the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the disease course. Tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota are involved in multiple physiological reactions, take indole for example, it participates in the process of inflam­ mation and anti-inflammatory effects through various cellular physiological activities mediated by aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), which can influence a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review mainly explores and summarizes the relationship between indoles and human neurological and neuro­ psychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, and puts forward that the level of indoles can be regulated through various direct or indirect ways to improve the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and reverse the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.},

	abstract = {In our previous study of 2,130 Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), we found that tryptophan (TRP) metabolites contributed to elevated risks of death. Many TRP-derived metabolites require the participation of intestinal bacteria to produce, and they play an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as CHD. So it is necessary to metabolize TRP into beneficial metabolites against CHD or prevent the production of harmful metabolites through external intervention. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) may be a key point of gut microbiota that causes TRP metabolism disorder and affects major adverse cardiovascular events in CHD. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a method based on
              in vitro
              culture bacteria to evaluate the effects of IBA on specific microbial metabolites quickly. We detected the concentrations of TRP and its metabolites in 11 bacterial strains isolated from feces using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and selected
              Clostridium sporogenes
              as the model strain. Then, IBA was used in our model to explore its effect on TRP metabolism. Results demonstrated that the optimal culture conditions of
              C. sporogenes
              were as follows: initial pH, 6.8; culture temperature, 37°C; and inoculum amount, 2\%. Furthermore, we found that IBA increases the production of TRP and 5-HIAA by intervening TRP metabolism, and inhibits the production of KYNA. This new bacteria-specific
              in vitro
              model provides a flexible, reproducible, and cost-effective tool for identifying harmful agents that can decrease the levels of beneficial TRP metabolites. It will be helpful for researchers when developing innovative strategies for studying gut microbiota.},

I3LA was selected as a candidate substance for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD), and its inhibitory effect on AD progression was investigated. Full-thickness human skin equivalents (HSEs) consisting of human-derived cells were generated on microﬂuidic chips and stimulated with major AD-inducing factors. The induced AD-HSEs were treated with I3LA for 7 days, and this affected the AD-associated genetic biomarkers and increased the expression of the major constituent proteins of the skin barrier. After the treatment for 14 days, the surface became rough and sloughed off, and there was no signiﬁcant difference between the increased AD-related mRNA expression and the skin barrier protein expression. Therefore, the short-term use of I3LA for approximately one week is considered to be effective in suppressing AD.},

	abstract = {Tryptamine, a neuromodulator derived from tryptophan, has been shown to significantly impact the host gut homeostasis through its production by the gut microbiota. However, the characterization of tryptamine-producing gut bacteria remains limited, the factors regulating tryptamine production largely unexplored, and its effects on the rest of the gut microbial community unknown. In this study, we screened 13 intestinal strains closely related to known tryptamine producers, characterized their production kinetics, and evaluated whether tryptophan decarboxylation to tryptamine contributes to acid stress tolerance, as shown in other amino acid-dependent acid tolerance systems. We also examined the impact of tryptamine on the composition and function of four healthy human gut microbiota by conducting 48-h
              ex vivo
              fecal batch fermentations. To complement the
              ex vivo
              experiments, we tested the effect of tryptamine exposure (range: 0.5–8 mM) on the growth of 18 intestinal strains. We identified tryptamine production in five taxa, i.e.,
              Enterocloster asparagiformis
              ,
              Blautia hansenii
              ,
              Clostridium nexile
              ,
              Clostridium sporogenes
              , and
              Ruminococcus gnavus
              , with
              R. gnavus
              DSM 108212 accumulating up to 3.4 mM tryptamine after 48 h. An increased tryptophan concentration led to higher tryptamine production. However, tryptamine production was not promoted at low pH and may not protect cells from acid-induced cellular damage. Exposing gut microbial communities to 2.4 mM tryptamine caused mild changes in gut microbiota function and composition. All donors showed reduced carbohydrate consumption after 5 h, leading to donor-specific alterations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (i.e., propionate, acetate, butyrate) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) (i.e., isobutyrate and isovalerate) after 48 h. Tryptamine also induced a mild change of community structure, with a consistent reduction in the phylum
              Bacteroidota
              as well as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) related to the genera
              Bacteroides
              ,
              Blautia
              , and

              in vitro
              at concentrations of 2 mM and above. Multiple gut commensals remained unaffected when exposed to 8 mM tryptamine. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that intestinal bacteria-derived tryptamine is a bioactive molecule that not only alters host homeostasis locally but also modulates the physiology of gut microbial communities. The specific mechanism through which tryptamine exerts its inhibitory effects on specific gut microbes while leaving others unaffected remains to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {Dietary nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves athletic performance in humans, yet data supporting observations that it may increase cerebral blood flow and improve cognitive performance are mixed. We tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish (
              Danio rerio
              ) model. We utilized targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to examine the extent to which treatment resulted in changes in nitrate or nitrite concentrations in the brain and altered the brain metabolome. Fish were exposed to sodium nitrate (606.9 mg/L), sodium nitrite (19.5 mg/L), or control water for 2–4 weeks and free swim, startle response, and shuttle box assays were performed. Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not change fish weight, length, predator avoidance, or distance and velocity traveled in an unstressed environment. Nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish initially experienced more negative reinforcement and increased time to decision in the shuttle box assay, which is consistent with a decrease in associative learning or executive function however, over multiple trials, all treatment groups demonstrated behaviors associated with learning. Nitrate and nitrite treatment was associated with mild anxiogenic-like behavior but did not alter epinephrine, norepinephrine or dopamine levels. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed no significant increase in brain nitrate or nitrite concentrations with treatment. Untargeted metabolomics analysis found 47 metabolites whose abundance was significantly altered in the brain with nitrate and nitrite treatment. Overall, the depletion in brain metabolites is plausibly associated with the regulation of neuronal activity including statistically significant reductions in the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 18–19\%), and its precursor, glutamine (17–22\%). Nitrate treatment caused significant depletion in the brain concentration of fatty acids including linoleic acid (LA) by 50\% and arachidonic acid (ARA) by 80\%; nitrite treatment caused depletion of LA by {\textasciitilde}90\% and ARA by 60\%, change which could alter the function of dopaminergic neurons and affect behavior. Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not adversely affect multiple parameters of zebrafish health. It is plausible that indirect NO-mediated mechanisms may be responsible for the nitrate and nitrite-mediated effects on the brain metabolome and behavior in zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Background: Interactions between the digestive system and the brain functions have become in recent years an important field of psychiatric research. These multidirectional interactions take place in the so called microbiotagut-brain axis and emerging scientific data indicate to the significant role of microbiota in the modulation of the central nervous system (CNS) including affective and cognitive functions.
Objective: An assessment of psychobiotic and immunomodulatory effects of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Plantarum 299v (LP299v) by measuring affective, cognitive functions and biochemical parameters in patients with MDD undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Design: Seventy nine patients with MDD were randomized and allocated to a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received either a SSRI with the probiotic LP299v (n = 40) for a period of 8 weeks or a SSRI with the placebo of the probiotic (n = 39) for the same period. The severity of psychiatric symptoms was assessed using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17), Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Cognitive functions were assessed using the Attention and Perceptivity Test (APT), Stroop Test parts A and B, Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT), Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Biochemical parameters such as tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HKYN), anthranilic acid (AA), 3-hydroxy anthranilic acid (3HAA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1b) and cortisol plasma concentrations were measured.
Results: Sixty participants finished the study and were analyzed: 30 participants in the LP299v group and 30 participants in the placebo group. There was an improvement in APT and in CVLT total recall of trials 1–5 in the LP299v group compared with the placebo between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. There was a significant decrease in KYN concentration in the LP299v group compared to the placebo group. We also observed significant increase in 3HKYN:KYN ratio in the LP299v group compared with the placebo group. Additionally, Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of interaction of Treatment x time for AA concentration. However, results of post hoc analysis did not reach statistical significance in neither probiotic nor placebo group. There were no significant changes of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1b and cortisol concentrations in neither probiotic nor placebo groups.
Conclusions: Augmentation of SSRI treatment with probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Plantarum 299v improved cognitive performance and decreased KYN concentration in MDD patients. Decreased KYN concentration could contribute to the improvement of cognitive functions in the LP299v group compared to the placebo group. To our knowledge results of this study are the first evidence of improvement of cognitive functions in MDD patients},

	abstract = {Background:  Dysregulation of gut microbiota-associated tryptophan metabolism has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, defining direct mechanistic links between this apparent metabolic rewiring and individual constituents of the gut microbiota remains challenging. We and others have previously shown that colonization with the gut commensal and putative probiotic species, Lactobacillus reuteri, unexpectedly enhances host susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis. To identify underlying mechanisms, we characterized the genome of commensal L. reuteri isolates, coupled with in vitro and in vivo metabolomic profiling, modulation of dietary substrates, and gut microbiota manipulation.
Results:  The enzymes necessary to metabolize dietary tryptophan into immunomodulatory indole derivatives were enriched in the L. reuteri genomes, including araT, fldH, and amiE. Moreover, metabolite profiling of L. reuteri monocultures and serum of L. reuteri-colonized mice revealed a depletion of kynurenines and production of a wide array of known and novel tryptophan-derived aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists and antagonists, including indole acetate, indole-3-glyoxylic acid, tryptamine, p-cresol, and diverse imidazole derivatives. Functionally, dietary tryptophan was required for L. reuteri-dependent EAE exacerbation, while depletion of dietary tryptophan suppressed disease activity and inflammatory T cell responses in the CNS. Mechanistically, L. reuteri tryptophan-derived metabolites activated the AhR and enhanced T cell production of IL-17.
Conclusions:  Our data suggests that tryptophan metabolism by gut commensals, such as the putative probiotic species L. reuteri, can unexpectedly enhance autoimmunity, inducing broad shifts in the metabolome and immunological repertoire.},

	abstract = {The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bilateral communication network between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system. The essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the normal growth and health of both animals and humans and, importantly, exerts modulatory functions at multiple levels of the GBA. Tryptophan is the sole precursor of serotonin, which is a key monoamine neurotransmitter participating in the modulation of central neurotransmission and enteric physiological function. In addition, tryptophan can be metabolized into kynurenine, tryptamine, and indole, thereby modulating neuroendocrine and intestinal immune responses. The gut microbial inﬂuence on tryptophan metabolism emerges as an important driving force in modulating tryptophan metabolism. Here, we focus on the potential role of tryptophan metabolism in the modulation of brain function by the gut microbiota. We start by outlining existing knowledge on tryptophan metabolism, including serotonin synthesis and degradation pathways of the host, and summarize recent advances in demonstrating the inﬂuence of the gut microbiota on tryptophan metabolism. The latest evidence revealing those mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates tryptophan metabolism, with subsequent eﬀects on brain function, is reviewed. Finally, the potential modulation of intestinal tryptophan metabolism as a therapeutic option for brain and GI functional disorders is also discussed. Adv Nutr 2020;11:709–723.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture plays an increasingly significant role in improving the sustainability of global fish production. This sector has been intensified with the advent of new husbandry practices and the development of new technology. However, the increasing intensification and indiscriminate commercialized farming has enhanced the vulnera­ bility of cultivated aquatic species to damage from pathogens. In efforts to confront these various diseases, frequent use of drugs, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, and agents for sterilization have unintentionally added to the risk of transmission of pathogens and harmful chemical compounds to consumers. Some natural dietary supplements are believed to have the potential to offset this setback in aquaculture. Application of bio-friendly feed additives such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics are becoming popular dietary supplements with the potential to not only improve growth performance, but in some cases can also enhance immune competence and the overall well-being of fish and crustaceans. The present review discusses and summarizes the effects of pro­ biotics, prebiotics and synbiotics application on growth, stress mitigation, microbial composition of intestine, immune system and health condition of aquatic animals in association with existing constraints and future perspectives in aquaculture.},

            It is unknown whether indoles, metabolites of tryptophan that are derived entirely from bacterial metabolism in the gut, are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Serum samples (baseline, 12 weeks) were drawn from participants (n = 196) randomized to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), escitalopram, or duloxetine for major depressive disorder. Baseline indoxyl sulfate abundance was positively correlated with severity of psychic anxiety and total anxiety and with resting state functional connectivity to a network that processes aversive stimuli (which includes the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC-FC), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior midcingulate cortex, and the right premotor areas). The relation between indoxyl sulfate and psychic anxiety was mediated only through the metabolite’s effect on the SCC-FC with the premotor area. Baseline indole abundances were unrelated to post-treatment outcome measures, and changes in symptoms were not correlated with changes in indole concentrations. These results suggest that CBT and antidepressant medications relieve anxiety via mechanisms unrelated to modulation of indoles derived from gut microbiota; it remains possible that treatment-related improvement stems from their impact on other aspects of the gut microbiome. A peripheral gut microbiome-derived metabolite was associated with altered neural processing and with psychiatric symptom (anxiety) in humans, which provides further evidence that gut microbiome disruption can contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders that may require different therapeutic approaches. Given the exploratory nature of this study, findings should be replicated in confirmatory studies.

Enzyme assays of cell-free extracts indicated that both species of Lactobacillus catabolized Trp to indole-3-lactic acid, and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography of culture supernatants showed this reaction occurred via successive transamination and dehydrogenation reactions. Tryptophan decarboxylase activity was also detected in all Lactobacillus cell-free extracts, but tryptamine was not detected in culture supernatants. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography showed that Trp metabolism in Lactobacillus casei LC301 and LC202 was similar under both incubation conditions and that those catabolic reactions were reversible (i.e., conversion of indole-3-lactic acid to Trp). In contrast, Trp catabolism by Lactobacillus helveticus LH212 was only detected under near cheese ripening conditions. Cells of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 did not catabolize Trp in either condition but did convert indole3-pyruvic acid to Trp in carbohydrate starvation medium and to Trp and indole-3-lactic acid under near cheese ripening conditions.},

Lastly, due to its ability to normalize both the quantitative parameters of the immune system and immune cells’ functional activity, B. coagulans can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the host immune system. Due to the evidence supporting various probiotic eﬀects of B. coagulans, many B. coagulans strains have been studied in the management and alleviation of several human diseases.

	abstract = {The development of non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain is a pressing area of unmet clinical need. To address this, we examined the expression of Gi/ocoupled receptors in colonic sensory neurons, which, like opioid receptors, have the potential to inhibit nociceptor activation due to their inhibitory G protein coupling. This led to the identification of the orphan receptor GPR35 as a visceral analgesic drug target due to its marked co-expression with TRPA1, a mediator of noxious mechanotransduction in the bowel. Consistent with in silico docking studies which identified binding sites for the mast cell stabiliser cromolyn and phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast at GPR35, we demonstrated, using GPR35 knockout mice, that the antinociceptive effects of these drugs on TRPA1mediated colonic nociceptor activation and mechanosensitisation were GPR35-dependent. Further work showed these antinociceptive effects occurred through the inhibition of substance P (SP) release. This confirmed both the pronociceptive effect of SP on colonic afferents, and the contribution of SP to TRPA1-mediated colonic nociceptor activation and sensitisation. We also found that TRPA1-induced contraction of the colon was mediated by SP signalling and could be inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. Our data identify GPR35, through its inhibition of SP-mediated colonic contractility and nociceptor activation and sensitisation, as a putative mechanism for the reported clinical efficacy of cromolyn in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. These findings highlight the potential utility of GPR35 agonists to deliver non-opioid analgesia for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.},

Compared with PS150, GR1009 have no significant hypnotic effects in the pentobarbital-induced sleep test in mice. In addition, we found that heat-killed PS150 exhibited hypnotic effects and altered the gut microbiota in a manner similar to live bacteria, suggesting that a heat-stable effector, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), could be responsible for these effects. Our comparative genomics analysis also revealed distinct genetic characteristics in EPS biosynthesis between GR1009 and PS150. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy imaging showed a sheet-like EPS structure in PS150, while GR1009 displayed no apparent EPS structure. Using the phenol-sulfate assay, we found that the sugar content value of the crude extract containing EPS (C-EPS) from PS150 was approximately five times higher than that of GR1009, indicating that GR1009 has a lower EPS production activity than PS150. Through the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, we confirmed the hypnotic effects of the C-EPS isolated from PS150, as evidenced by a significant reduction in sleep latency and recovery time following oral administration in mice. In summary, we utilized a comparative approach to delineate differences between PS150 and GR1009 and proposed that EPS may serve as a key factor that mediates the observed hypnotic effect.},

            Despite the longstanding appreciation that how we move, think, and feel has an impact on stomach function, the areas of the cerebral cortex that are the origin of these influences are largely unknown. Here we identify the cortical areas that influence the rat stomach. Output neurons in the rostral insula are the major cortical source of influence over parasympathetic control of the stomach, whereas output neurons in sensorimotor areas of the cortex are the major source of influence over sympathetic control. Thus, cortical areas involved in action, interoception, and emotion differentially influence stomach function.
          , 
            The central nervous system both influences and is influenced by the gastrointestinal system. Most research on this gut–brain connection has focused on how ascending signals from the gut and its microbiome alter brain function. Less attention has focused on how descending signals from the central nervous system alter gut function. Here, we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify the cortical areas that most directly influence parasympathetic and sympathetic control of the rat stomach. Cortical neurons that influence parasympathetic output to the stomach originated from the rostral insula and portions of medial prefrontal cortex, regions that are associated with interoception and emotional control. In contrast, cortical neurons that influence sympathetic output to the stomach originated overwhelmingly from the primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and secondary motor cortex, regions that are linked to skeletomotor control and action. Clearly, the two limbs of autonomic control over the stomach are influenced by distinct cortical networks.},

In the intervening period, identiﬁcation of strong expression in the lower intestine and colon, in a variety of immune cells including monocytes and a variety of dendritic cells, and in dorsal root ganglia has suggested potential therapeutic opportunities in targeting this receptor in a range of conditions. GPR35 is, however, unusual in a variety of ways that challenge routes to translation. These include the following: (i) Although a substantial range and diversity of endogenous ligands have been suggested as agonist partners for this receptor, it oﬃcially remains deﬁned as an “orphan” GPCR. (ii) Humans express two distinct protein isoform sequences, while rodents express only a single form. (iii) The pharmacologies of the human and rodent orthologues of GPR35 are very distinct, with variation between rat and mouse GPR35 being as marked as that between either of these species and the human forms. Herein we provide perspectives on each of the topics above as well as suggesting ways to overcome the challenges currently hindering potential translation. These include a better understanding of the extent and molecular basis for species selective GPR35 pharmacology and the production of novel mouse models in which both “on-target” and “oﬀtarget” eﬀects of presumptive GPR35 ligands can be better deﬁned, as well as a clear understanding of the human isoform expression proﬁle and its signiﬁcance at both tissue and individual cell levels.},

In order to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of P. salmonis, appropriate molecular and cellular studies in multiple cell lines with different origins need to be conducted. Toward that end, we established a cell viability assay that is suitable for high-throughput analysis using the alamarBlue reagent to follow the distinct stages of the bacterial infection cycle. Changes in host cell viability can be easily detected using either an absorbanceor ﬂuorescence-based plate reader. Our method accurately tracked the infection cycle across two different Atlantic salmon-derived cell lines, with macrophage and epithelial cell properties, and zebraﬁsh primary cell cultures. Analyses were also carried out to quantify intracellular bacterial replication in combination with ﬂuorescence microscopy to visualize P. salmonis and cellular structures in ﬁxed cells. In addition, dual gene expression analysis showed that the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα were upregulated, while the cytokines IL1b and IFNγ were downregulated in the three cell culture types. The expression of the P. salmonis metal uptake and heme acquisition genes, together with the toxin and effector genes ospD3, ymt, pipB2 and pepO, were upregulated at the early and late stages of infection regardless of the cell culture type. On the other hand, Dot/Icm secretion system genes as well as stationary state and nutrient scarcity-related genes were upregulated only at the late stage of P. salmonis intracellular infection. We propose that these genes encoding putative P. salmonis virulence factors and immune-related proteins could be suitable biomarkers of P. salmonis infection. The infection protocol and cell viability assay described here provide a reliable method to compare the molecular and cellular changes induced by P. salmonis in other cell lines and has the potential to be used for high-throughput screenings of novel antimicrobials targeting this important ﬁsh intracellular pathogen.},

Due to their multifunctional properties, these peptides are a focus of growing body of interest and have been characterized in several ﬁsh species. Due to their similarities in amino-acid composition and amphipathic design, it has been suggested that neuropeptides may be directly involved in the innate immune response against pathogen intruders. In this review, we report the molecular characterization of the ﬁsh-speciﬁc AMP piscidin1, the production of an antibody raised against this peptide and the immunohistochemical identiﬁcation of this peptide and enkephalins in the neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gill of several teleost ﬁsh species living in different habitats. In spite of the abundant literature on Piscidin1, the biological role of this peptide in ﬁsh visceral organs remains poorly explored, as well as the role of the neuropeptides in neuroimmune interaction in ﬁsh. The NECs, by their role as sensors of hypoxia changes in the external environments, in combination with their endocrine nature and secretion of immunomodulatory substances would inﬂuence various types of immune cells that contain piscidin, such as mast cells and eosinophils, both showing interaction with the nervous system. The discovery of piscidins in the gill and skin, their diversity and their role in the regulation of immune response will lead to better selection of these immunomodulatory molecules as drug targets to retain antimicrobial barrier function and for aquaculture therapy in the future.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms of gastrointestinal protection by probiotic bacteria against infection involve amongst others, modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier function. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is widely used to evaluate cellular barrier functions. Here, we developed a two-stage interpretative model of the time-dependence of the TEER of epithelial layers grown in a transwell during Escherichia coli challenges in the absence or presence of adhering biﬁdobacteria. E. coli adhesion in absence or presence of adhering biﬁdobacteria was enumerated using selective plating. After 4–8 h, E. coli challenges increased TEER to a maximum due to bacterial adhesion and increased expression of a tight-junction protein [zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)], concurrent with a less dense layer structure, that is indicative of mild epithelial layer damage. Before the occurrence of a TEER-maximum, decreases in electrical conductance (i.e., the reciprocal TEER) did not relate with para-cellular dextran-permeability, but after occurrence of a TEERmaximum, dextran-permeability and conductance increased linearly, indicative of more severe epithelial layer damage. Within 24 h after the occurrence of a TEER maximum, TEER decreased to below the level of unchallenged epithelial layers demonstrating microscopically observable holes and apoptosis. Under probiotic protection by adhering biﬁdobacteria, TEER-maxima were delayed or decreased in magnitude due to later transition from mild to severe damage, but similar linear relations between conductance and dextran permeability were observed as in absence of adhering biﬁdobacteria. Based on the time-dependence of the TEER and the relation between conductance and dextran-permeability, it is proposed that bacterial adhesion to epithelial layers ﬁrst causes mild damage, followed by more severe damage after the occurrence of a TEERmaximum. The mild damage caused by E. coli prior to the occurrence of TEER maxima was reversible upon antibiotic treatment, but the severe damage after occurrence of TEER maxima could not be reverted by antibiotic treatment. Thus, single-time TEER is interpretable in two ways, depending whether increasing to or decreasing from its maximum. Adhering biﬁdobacteria elongate the time-window available for antibiotic treatment to repair initial pathogen damage to intestinal epithelial layers.},

These metabolites are suggested to activate the immune system through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), enhance the intestinal epithelial barrier, stimulate gastrointestinal motility, as well as secretion of gut hormones, exert anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative or toxic effects in systemic circulation, and putatively modulate gut microbial composition. Tryptophan catabolites thus affect various physiological processes and may contribute to intestinal and systemic homeostasis in health and disease.},

              The incidence of metabolic syndrome is significantly higher in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Gut microbiota is causatively linked with the development of both metabolic dysfunctions and gastrointestinal disorders, thus gut dysbiosis in IBS may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. Here, we show that human gut bacterium
              Ruminococcus gnavus
              -derived tryptamine and phenethylamine play a pathogenic role in gut dysbiosis-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and IBS. We show levels of
              R. gnavus
              , tryptamine, and phenethylamine are positively associated with insulin resistance in T2D patients and IBS patients. Monoassociation of
              R. gnavus
              impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose control in germ-free mice. Mechanistically, treatment of
              R. gnavus
              -derived metabolites tryptamine and phenethylamine directly impair insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues of healthy mice and monkeys and this effect is mediated by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis. Our findings suggest a causal role for tryptamine/phenethylamine-producers in the development of insulin resistance, provide molecular mechanisms for the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in IBS, and highlight the TAAR1 signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome induced by gut dysbiosis.},

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a broad microbial concept, some of which have been developed as probiotics. However, the capacity of most LAB to metabolize tryptophan is unknown. In this study, the aim is to reveal the rule of tryptophan metabolism in LAB by multi-omics. The findings showed that LAB were rich in genes for tryptophan catabolism and that multiple genes were shared among LAB species. Although the number of their homologous sequences was different, they could still form the same metabolic enzyme system. The metabolomic analysis revealed that LAB were capable of producing a variety of metabolites. Strains belonging to the same species can produce the same metabolites and have similar yields. A few strains showed strain-specificity in the production of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-acetic acid, and 3-indolealdehyde (IAld). In the genotype-phenotype association analysis, the metabolites of LAB were found to be highly consistent with the outcomes of gene prediction, particularly ILA, indole-3-propionic acid, and indole-3-pyruvic acid. The overall prediction accuracy was more than 87\% on average, which indicated the predictability of tryptophan metabolites of LAB. Additionally, genes influenced the concentration of metabolites. The levels of ILA and IAld were significantly correlated with the numbers of aromatic amino acid aminotransferase and amidase, respectively. The unique indolelactate dehydrogenase in
              Ligilactobacillus salivarius
              was the primary factor contributing to its large production of ILA. In summary, we demonstrated the gene distribution and production level of tryptophan metabolism in LAB and explored the correlation between genes and phenotypes. The predictability and specificity of the tryptophan metabolites in LAB were proven. These results provide a novel genomic method for the discovery of LAB with tryptophan metabolism potential and offer experimental data for probiotics that produce specific tryptophan metabolites.},

The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri and products of tryptophan degradation, specifically the neuroactive kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA), have received special attention in this context. We, therefore, assessed relevant features of KP metabolism, namely, the cellular uptake of the pivotal metabolite kynurenine and its conversion to its primary products KYNA, 3-hydroxykynurenine and anthranilic acid in L. reuteri by incubating the bacteria in Hank’s Balanced Salt solution in vitro. Kynurenine readily entered the bacterial cells and was preferentially converted to KYNA, which was promptly released into the extracellular milieu. De novo production of KYNA increased linearly with increasing concentrations of kynurenine (up to 1 mM) and bacteria (107 to 109 CFU/mL) and with incubation time (1–3 h). KYNA neosynthesis was blocked by two selective inhibitors of mammalian kynurenine aminotransferase II (PF-048559989 and BFF-122). In contrast to mammals, however, kynurenine uptake was not influenced by other substrates of the mammalian large neutral amino acid transporter, and KYNA production was not affected by the presumed competitive enzyme substrates (glutamine and α-aminoadipate). Taken together, these results reveal substantive qualitative differences between bacterial and mammalian KP metabolism.},

	abstract = {Chemokines are increasingly recognised as playing a role in depression. Here we meta-analyse the data on concentrations of all chemokines in patients diagnosed with a major depression versus healthy controls. We included studies which utilised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression, participants free from major medical conditions, studies with healthy controls, and unstimulated measurements of chemokines. We only included chemokines which had ≥3 studies performed. Two chemokines and 15 studies in total met criteria for this meta-analysis; 8 for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 (n = 747), and 7 for Interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 (n = 560). There were signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of CCL2/MCP-1 in depressed subjects compared with control subjects – overall mean difference of 36.43 pg/mL (95\% CI: 2.43 to 70.42). There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity across these studies (I2 = 98.5\%). The estimates of mean difference between the control and depression groups did not remain signiﬁcant when the trim-and-ﬁll procedure was used to correct for publication bias. There was no signiﬁcant difference in concentrations of IL-8/CXCL8 in depressed subjects compared with control subjects. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found across these studies (I2 = 96.7\%). The estimates of mean difference between the control and depression groups remained non-signiﬁcant when the trim-and-ﬁll procedure was used to correct for publication bias. This metaanalysis reports signiﬁcantly heterogeneity in this ﬁeld among studies. There are higher concentrations of the chemokine MCP-1/CCL2 in depressed subjects compared with control subjects, and no differences for IL-8/ CXCL8. More high quality research and consistent methodologies are needed in this important area of enquiry. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Obesity and depression are among the most pressing health problems in the contemporary world. Obesity and depression share a bidirectional relationship, whereby each condition increases the risk of the other. By inference, shared pathways may underpin the comorbidity between obesity and depression. Activation of cellmediated immunity (CMI) is a key factor in the pathophysiology of depression. CMI cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-1β, induce the catabolism of tryptophan (TRY) by stimulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) resulting in the synthesis of kynurenine (KYN) and other tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). In the CNS, TRYCATs have been related to oxidative damage, inﬂammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytotoxicity, excitotoxicity, neurotoxicity and lowered neuroplasticity. The pathophysiology of obesity is also associated with a state of aberrant inﬂammation that activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a pathway involved in the detection of intracellular or environmental changes as well as with increases in the production of TRYCATs, being KYN an agonists of AHR. Both AHR and TRYCATS are involved in obesity and related metabolic disorders. These changes in the TRYCAT pathway may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in obesity. This paper reviews the role of immune activation, IDO stimulation and increased TRYCAT production in the pathophysiology of depression and obesity. Here we suggest that increased synthesis of detrimental TRYCATs is implicated in comorbid obesity and depression and is a new drug target to treat both diseases.},

	abstract = {Host factors in the intestine help select for bacteria that promote health. Certain commensals can utilize mucins as an energy source, thus promoting their colonization. However, health conditions such as inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with a reduced mucus layer, potentially leading to dysbiosis associated with this disease. We characterize the capability of commensal species to cleave and transport mucin-associated monosaccharides and identify several Clostridiales members that utilize intestinal mucins. One such mucin utilizer, Peptostreptococcus russellii, reduces susceptibility to epithelial injury in mice. Several Peptostreptococcus species contain a gene cluster enabling production of the tryptophan metabolite indoleacrylic acid (IA), which promotes intestinal epithelial barrier function and mitigates inﬂammatory responses. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis of human stool samples reveals that the genetic capability of microbes to utilize mucins and metabolize tryptophan is diminished in IBD patients. Our data suggest that stimulating IA production could promote anti-inﬂammatory responses and have therapeutic beneﬁts.},

	abstract = {Endogenous tryptophan (Trp) metabolites have an important role in mammalian gut immune homeostasis, yet the potential contribution of Trp metabolites from resident microbiota has never been addressed experimentally. Here, we describe a metabolic pathway whereby Trp metabolites from the microbiota balance mucosal reactivity in mice. Switching from sugar to Trp as an energy source (e.g., under conditions of unrestricted Trp availability), highly adaptive lactobacilli are expanded and produce an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand—indole3-aldehyde—that contributes to AhR-dependent Il22 transcription. The resulting IL-22-dependent balanced mucosal response allows for survival of mixed microbial communities yet provides colonization resistance to the fungus Candida albicans and mucosal protection from inﬂammation. Thus, the microbiota-AhR axis might represent an important strategy pursued by coevolutive commensalism for ﬁne tuning host mucosal reactivity contingent on Trp catabolism.},
